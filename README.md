# Sleep-Quality-and-Mental-Health

After reviewing the codebook for the "Sleep Quality and Mental Health Symptoms in Emergency Medical Service Personnel" study, I found the connection between sleep quality and symptoms of PTSD and depression in EMS workers very interesting. EMS personnel work long, unpredictable shifts and face a lot of trauma, so I wondered if differences in age and gender might explain why some workers experience more severe symptoms
than others. This curiosity led me to develop my research question "How do age and gender interact to influence PTSD, depression, and sleep quality in emergency medical service personnel?"
